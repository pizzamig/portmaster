3.18.0
pkg is now mandatory. No pkg_* support anymore.

-n is not incompatible anymore with -l and -L
	-l and -L doesn't perform any changes, so it's always a dry-run

Removing support and warning to undocumented path of portmaster.rc
	Only /usr/local/etc/portmaster.rc and $HOME/.portmasterrc will be supported
